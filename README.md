pem-parser
==========
Breaks apart CA Certificate files that contain multiple PEMs into an array of PEMs. This is useful when you are passing CA Certificate files which contains multiple PEMs into tls.connect.

The [TLS documentation](http://nodejs.org/api/tls.html#tls_tls_connect_port_host_options_callback) indicates that the ca option can be either a string containing a single PEM or an array of strings, each containing its own PEM.

## Install

```
$ npm install pem-parser
```

## Usage

```js
var PEMParser = require('pem-parser');
var caCerts = PEMParser.loadCACertsFromFile(caCertFilename); // caCertFilename can contain multiple PEMs.
var socket = require('tls').connect(this.port, this.host, {
  key:  fs.readFileSync(keyFile),
  cert: fs.readFileSync(certFile),
  ca: caCerts
}, function(){
  console.log('Connected!');
});

// or alternatively, you can do:
var fileContents = fs.readFileSync(caCertFilename).toString();
var caCerts = PEMParser.loadCACerts(fileContents);
```
